# Conway
===========

Implementation of Conway's Game of Life using C++ and SDL 2.0.

Simulation starts full-screen, paused with several gliders drawn on the board.
 - Press 'Spacebar' to start simulation.
 - Press 'Enter' to pause simulation.
 - Press 'ESC' to exit the simulation. Will take 5 to 30 seconds to unallocate memory.
 - When simulation is paused, 'LEFT CLICK' any with the mouse will flip the tile states. Can drag mouse across board for a line of live/dead tiles.

Tested on Ubuntu (18.04) w GCC 4.9.0. Compile using make file in the src folder.
